Team 281 Vision System Instructions
=============================================

Running and Installing
=========================
This code is meant to be installed on a system using supervisorD. 

Rough steps are as follows
 
  1. Install system Dependencies ( see doc/PiSetupSteps). Dependencies include supervisord, python3, opencv, numpy
  2. symlink /etc/supervisor/conf.d/vision.conf to conf/vision.conf
  3. make /var/log/vision directory and make sure it is writable by the pi user
  4. configure supervisor to start on boot


Updating From Source
=====================
run update_code.sh. this will pull the latest from bitbucket

After you do that, you'll want to re-load the processes:

sudo supervisorctl restart all


Restarting Processes
=====================
The processes run using supervisord. you can see their status, logs, and restart them with these commands:

sudo supervisorctl status             #see status of all processes
sudo supervisorctl restart all        #restart all processes
sudo supervisorctl tail visionapp     #see recent logs from visionapp

Seeing CPU Status
==========================
run 'htop' at a terminal.  

Changing and Erasing Vision Defaults
=======================================

defaults can be saved using the 'save defaults button in the web interface.
These are saved to the pi home directory, /home/pi/vision-defaults.json.

this file can be changed manually, or if removed the system will revert to the prior baked in defaults
